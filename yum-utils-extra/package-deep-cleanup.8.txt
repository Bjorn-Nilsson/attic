PACKAGE-DEEP-CLEANUP(8)
=======================
:doctype: manpage



NAME
----
package-deep-cleanup - Clean up the system using a list of explicitly
installed packages.



SYNOPSIS
--------
*package-deep-cleanup* ['FILE' ...]



DESCRIPTION
-----------
The package-deep-cleanup(8) command will read a list of required software
packages from input files and use it to bring the system to a specific state
by installing missing packages and removing unnecessary ones.



USE CASES AND MOTIVATION
------------------------
Users of various Linux distributions tend to use their favorite package
management tool to install software on their system. After some time they
usually end up with lots of software packages installed on their system.

When they want to clean-up their system they usually have three choices:

- Go through the tedious process of trying to remove each package hoping
  that (due to dependencies) it won't bring down the whole system;
- Reinstall the system from scratch;
- Hope that their package management tool is able to track explicitly
  installed packages and thus remove all unnecessary packages whenever the
  user uninstalls a package.

Some tools (i.e.: aptitude and emerge) come with the third option
out-of-the-box.

Yum, however, is not (yet) capable of tracking explicit installations. It
provides a couple of tools (i.e.: remove-leaves plug-in and package-cleanup
tool) but they must be used from the beginning (remove-leaves plug-in) or they
are often inaccurate (package-cleanup).



EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
        No errors

*1*::
        Failure
